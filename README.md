This is a Laravel-based full stack framework project, which allows users to register accounts and post photos. It was created for the MVC course at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

A large part of the app's login functionality is based on a [YouTube tutorial series by Fuyu/渋谷で働くエンジニア福](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5PPCfcpq4A&list=PLCyDm9NTxdhLV5LFfCoRykyHW8Zw91YJB).
